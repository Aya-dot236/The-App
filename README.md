# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refres

This is Aya-dot-236 This is my First React-Project running on Github.
It took time and fixing multiple errors for my props and Components to work.
Props is a short term for properties, properties are attributes that define or describe an entity, object or system. My work that consist of my props are also joined by my "React Hooks" assignment React Hooks special functions in react that allow you to usestate and other react features.
I used the Usestate and Useeffect 
UseState allows you to add state to functional component i will give you a simple example that is similar to my work: Const {Count, setCount}=UseState(0)
But before using the usestate i had to first Import both the UseState and UseEffect by my component "Counter".
UseEffect allows you to run side effects for example making a API call or setting up an event listener.
After i was done writing my code and fixing my errors as a Main i had ro run a couple of commands in order to Push
i started with 
Git init
git status
git add .
git commint -m""
finally! Git Push                                                                                                   
And the most important thing i learnt from making this project is that you can never return a component TWICE you can only return an Array.
